# STATE (operator working state; keep ≤8 KB; overwrite, don't append)

authority: owner-directed cloud scheduled task; hourly from 2026-10-27 10:00 until 2026-12-08 10:00 ET (owner 2026-10-29: hourly through the Black Friday deal window), then every 4 hours; ends 2027-01-15 17:00 America/New_York (extended by owner 2026-10-28)
caps: 1 transaction per run; daily_cap=none (owner 2026-10-27: no daily limit; the run cadence and the 90-minute lock are the only throttle)

## Holds (one line each: what, unblock condition)
- Deal watch (G09, 8daaacb): .github/workflows/deal-watch.yml commits ops/deal-watch/state.json and flags.json to main when an official deal page changes (hourly at :23); always fetch and merge before releasing; pending flags are G09w work.
- Cadence: the Oct 30 one-shot reminder to switch to every 4h (trig_01Ccfq2FQJBy7UbQGESFpLF8) is superseded by the owner's 2026-10-29 decision; ignore it. The 2026-12-08 reminder (trig_016a6JJcR9FqbUGzGbmr9ZXi) makes the switch.
- /deals/ checks end Oct 31 (Beaches), Nov 1 (Great Wolf; year is our reading), Nov 2 (Royal Caribbean; NCL Free 2nd Guest, whose 3rd/4th-guest part has no stated end; MSC, whose terms say Nov 5), Nov 3 (Margaritaville at Sea), Nov 17 (LEGOLAND California hotel package), Nov 22 (Atlantis Fall Into Paradise; year is our reading), Dec 31 (SeaWorld Fun Card; no purchase deadline stated, re-observe weekly from Nov 4), Jan 6 (Club Med); tools/this-week.mjs re-renders deal pages daily too, and the committed deal pages must match today's render or tests fail.
- /this-week/ items expire daily: the deploy workflow (daily 05:17 UTC) refreshes the live copy, but the committed site/this-week/index.html must be re-rendered (`node tools/this-week.mjs`, commit) on the first run each Eastern day or `node --test` fails the committed-page test. Next item expiry: Nov 4 (DC lottery).
- Social posting (G04, a568c5b; Zernio route G08, 16e5ad8): .github/workflows/social-post.yml runs at :40 past the slot hours and posts nothing until the owner adds ZERNIO_API_KEY (or direct secrets) (T3); with the key, all connected platforms post through Zernio. Since G04b (e389a0c) it posts Threads, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest (Bluesky removed); Pinterest needs PINTEREST_TOKEN (30-day expiry, owner replaces monthly) + PINTEREST_BOARD_ID, added only once the app has Standard access. Once live it commits receipts to ops/social-receipts/ on main several times a day: always fetch and merge before releasing. A failed or stuck "attempting" receipt is never retried; report it to the owner.
- Social queues: ops/social-queue/2026-10-29.json through 2026-11-04.json are committed (Nov 4: first posts for NYBG, Universal, EPCOT; Hyde Park, Chicago ZooLights, Bronx Zoo repeats skipped with stored reasons); nothing posts until the owner's secrets exist (T3). While a queue date is today or later, tools/social-queue.test.mjs fails if its records change: regenerate the queue (and cards) in the same commit; regeneration keeps stored skips. Queue Nov 5+ in G05. To change only post text in existing queues, refresh entry texts in place (regenerating an older date with today's records reselects entries) (`node tools/social-queue.mjs <date> [--skip <id> "<reason>"]`); decide repeats deliberately; never filler.
- Growth-first since 2026-10-28 (OWNER D10–D12): work G items before old Q items, except live-site defects and the Q17b deadline. Posting waits for the owner's accounts and GitHub secrets (T3).
- Orlando admission tariffs observed 2026-10-27; re-observe by 2026-11-10 (the form flags them as older for later visit dates).
- GSC: sitemap resubmitted and indexing requested for the 5 unknown URLs on 2026-10-27 (OWNER.md T1). Check their coverage in the next GSC snapshots; no repeat requests.
- Sitemap lastmod for 21 pages unchanged since the 2026-10-15 import is an estimate (visible date or 2026-10-13 bound); it becomes observed the next time each page changes. No action needed.
- DC itinerary official facts observed 2026-10-27 (14-day maintenance clock in tools/site-maintenance.mjs); re-observe before showing them as current after Nov 10. New URL not yet known to Google; no indexing request without an Approved OWNER.md row.
- Boston itinerary official facts observed 2026-10-27 (14-day clock in tools/site-maintenance.mjs); Aquarium prices and MBTA adult fares unknown (ticket site JS-only; mbta.com robots.txt blocks AI agents, do not fetch). New URL not yet known to Google; no indexing request without an Approved OWNER.md row.
- Remote branches q/Q02b…q/Q15b, q/Q02c, q/Q02d, q/Q07, q/Q08, q/Q09, q/Q09b, q/Q09c, q/Q09c-dc, q/Q09c-cancun, q/Q09c-london, q/Q09c-orlando, q/G02, q/G03, q/G04b, q/G05, q/G05-uo, q/G05-epcot, q/G05-nybg (if deletion refused) and q/G07 remain because remote deletion is refused; harmless.
- Owner's Mac checkout is stale after 2026-10-27 (its 20 local files are preserved on branch owner-local-2026-10-27). Never commit from the Mac; the operator works only in cloud clones.

- Seven hotel pages show November 8-13, 2026 price samples; past-stay from arrival Nov 8, so the fix must be live by 2026-11-07 (Q17a found all 4 candidate engines blocked too; Q17b removes all 15 unless OWNER O2 supplies observations; start Nov 3).

## Last run
- 2026-10-29 G09 step 2 on main d3f7909 (no site change): each deal check carries a validated score; Worth it needs observed 2+2 family math (none yet, so all 10 checks are Only for); urgency derived from the deadline; novelty from a quick coverage search; Skip deals never queue. Reviewer FAIL (2 P2 fixed) then PASS_WITH_P3. Deal-watch workflow had no runs yet at 13:40 UTC.
- 2026-10-29 G09 step 1 on main 8daaacb (no site change): hourly watch of 17 official deal pages (robots.txt and Crawl-delay honored, ≥55 min between runs, blocked sources never retried unchanged); changes become flags in ops/deal-watch/flags.json that the new top QUEUE item G09w takes first. Reviewer FAIL (1 P1, 3 P2 fixed) then PASS_WITH_P3. First live runs not yet seen.
- 2026-10-29 G08 Zernio posting on main 16e5ad8 (no site change): with ZERNIO_API_KEY, Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Pinterest post through Zernio to accounts looked up at run time; receipts, never-post-twice (plus Zernio Idempotency-Key), caps, expiry and D12 kill switch unchanged; simulated dry run 4/4 on the Nov 4 queue. Reviewer PASS_WITH_P3 (4 fixed, 3 carried). G08 stays open for the first live-post check.
