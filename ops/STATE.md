## Holds (one line each: what, unblock condition)
- Deal watch (G09, 8daaacb): .github/workflows/deal-watch.yml commits ops/deal-watch/state.json and flags.json to main when an official deal page changes (hourly at :23); always fetch and merge before releasing; pending flags are G09w work.
- Cadence: trig_016a6JJcR9FqbUGzGbmr9ZXi switches to 4h on 2026-12-08.
- /deals/ checks end Oct 31 (Beaches), Nov 1 (Great Wolf; year is our reading), Nov 2 (Royal Caribbean; NCL Free 2nd Guest, whose 3rd/4th-guest part has no stated end; MSC, whose terms say Nov 5), Nov 17 (LEGOLAND California hotel package), Nov 6 (Sesame Place Philadelphia pass: no end date stated, listed one week; re-read the pass page from Nov 6 to extend; LEGOLAND New York 2027 pass, same, listed to Nov 6), Nov 22 (Atlantis Fall Into Paradise; year is our reading), Dec 31 (SeaWorld Fun Card; no purchase deadline stated, re-observe weekly from Nov 4; Busch Gardens Tampa Bay Fun Card, same, re-observe from Nov 6; SeaWorld San Diego Fun Card, same, $99.99 may be an October price, re-observe from Nov 8), Nov 8 (SeaWorld San Antonio 2027 Season Pass and Sesame Place San Diego 2027 Silver Pass: no end date, listed one week; re-read their pages from Nov 8 to extend), Jan 6 (Club Med); tools/this-week.mjs re-renders deal pages daily too, and the committed deal pages must match today's render or tests fail.
- /this-week/ items expire daily: the deploy workflow (daily 05:17 UTC) refreshes the live copy, but the committed site/this-week/index.html must be re-rendered (`node tools/this-week.mjs`, commit) on the first run each Eastern day or `node --test` fails the committed-page test. Next item expiry: Nov 4 (DC lottery). SD with kids and teens ticket prices observed 2026-11-01 (LEGOLAND 10-30); re-observe before showing as current after Dec 1.
- Social posting (G04/G08 Zernio): ZERNIO_API_KEY live; only Facebook connected (others logged `not_connected`); posts Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest (Pinterest needs PINTEREST_TOKEN + PINTEREST_BOARD_ID). Receipts land in ops/social-receipts/ on main: fetch and merge before releasing. A failed or stuck "attempting" receipt is never retried; report it to the owner.
- Social queues: ops/social-queue/2026-10-29.json through 2026-11-07.json are committed (SeaWorld San Antonio not queued; re-read its pass page from Nov 8); nothing posts until the owner's secrets exist (T3). While a queue date is today or later, tools/social-queue.test.mjs fails if its records change: regenerate the queue (and cards) in the same commit; regeneration keeps stored skips. Queue Nov 8+ in G05; Oct 28 event records pass the 14-day observation limit after Nov 11: re-observe them first. To change only post text in existing queues, refresh entry texts in place (regenerating an older date with today's records reselects entries) (`node tools/social-queue.mjs <date> [--skip <id> "<reason>"]`); decide repeats deliberately; never filler.
- Growth-first (D10–D12): G items before old Q items, except live-site defects and Q17b. D22: only real deals (card saves ≥5%) are queued, posted or promoted; regenerate queues when a card changes.
- Orlando admission tariffs observed 2026-10-27; re-observe by 2026-11-10 (the form flags them as older for later visit dates).
- GSC: sitemap resubmitted and indexing requested for the 5 unknown URLs on 2026-10-27 (OWNER.md T1). Check their coverage in the next GSC snapshots; no repeat requests.
- Sitemap lastmod of 21 pages unchanged since 10-15 is an estimate; observed once each page changes.
- DC itinerary official facts observed 2026-10-27 (14-day maintenance clock in tools/site-maintenance.mjs); re-observe before showing them as current after Nov 10. New URL not yet known to Google; no indexing request without an Approved OWNER.md row.
- Boston itinerary official facts observed 2026-10-27 (14-day clock in tools/site-maintenance.mjs); Aquarium prices and MBTA adult fares unknown (ticket site JS-only; mbta.com robots.txt blocks AI agents, do not fetch). New URL not yet known to Google; no indexing request without an Approved OWNER.md row.
- Owner's Mac stale since 10-27 (branch owner-local-2026-10-27); cloud clones only.
- SD, NYC, Orlando, Boston and London Google listings (live since 0bb7a64f / 1af5ebd7 / 19cc3b6f / 42e7a8d8) leave their pages 2027-01-08: the *-google-sample/-listing tests (and PV example-stay test) fail from that date until `node tools/generate-pages.mjs` is run and committed.

- Cancun price card (dffcec9f) uses Nov 9-12 samples: before Nov 9 withdraw them (bump PASSED_AS_OF in src/prototypes/cancun-resort-comparison/render.mjs only after removing; tools/cancun-price-card.test.mjs fails from Nov 9) and regenerate; the grandparents Nov 9-12 table too.

- D23 3n: NYC with kids on q/D23-3n not merged (persona 3.87 after 3 cycles; O22); lead width fix not re-reviewed; merge main and regenerate first.
- D23 3o: Chicago with kids on q/D23-3o not merged (persona 3.53, design 3.86 after 3 cycles; O23); desktop line-length fix not re-reviewed; merge main and regenerate first; source count test 519 will collide with q/D23-3n.
- D23 3q: SD toddlers on q/D23-3q not merged (persona 4.0, design 4.0; integrity one P2 at cycle 3; O24); P2 (Coronado read date) fixed, not re-reviewed; merge main and regenerate first.
- D23 3r: Orlando kids on q/D23-3r not merged (persona 3.8, design 3.86 after 3 cycles; O25); last fixes not re-reviewed. Re-read 5 Orlando rate pages from Nov 3, before Nov 10; Oct 13 facts too.
- Q19: SA page on q/Q19 not merged (persona 3.80 after 3 cycles; O21). Regenerate after merging main. SD/NYC Jan 19 receipts in docs/research/dataforseo-q19-sd-nyc-*; July samples still live on SD, NYC, SA.
